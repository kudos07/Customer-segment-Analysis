# Customer Personality Analysis

![Project Image](<URL to Project Image>)

This repository contains code and analysis for Customer Personality Analysis based on the Kaggle dataset: [Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).

## Overview

Customer Personality Analysis is an essential aspect of understanding and catering to the unique needs and behaviors of customers. In this project, we have utilized various data analysis techniques, including agglomerative clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), outlier detection, and feature engineering. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Kaggle Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle: [Customer Personality Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). Make sure to download and explore the dataset for a better understanding of the data.

## Techniques Used

1. **Agglomerative Clustering:** We applied agglomerative clustering to group customers based on their similarities, allowing us to identify patterns within the data.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA was used for dimensionality reduction, enabling us to represent the data in a more concise form while preserving important information.

3. **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling outliers is crucial for accurate analysis. We employed outlier detection techniques to identify and address anomalies in the data.

4. **Feature Engineering:** We performed feature engineering tasks such as extracting information from the date of birth to enhance the dataset and provide additional insights.
